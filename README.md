This project is a simple command-line calculator application written in Java. 
The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers entered by the user.
The program ensures smooth user interaction by validating inputs and providing error handling for invalid entries. 
This is a very basic project used as a method to build up my skills.
